# Claude Cowork Plugin Handbooks

**Comprehensive, business-friendly guides for every Anthropic Knowledge Work Plugin.**

These handbooks turn Anthropic's [official plugin source code](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) into practical, readable guides for business users. Each handbook covers every command, skill, connector, and workflow — explained for the people who *use* the tools, not the people who built them.

> 145,000+ words across 12 handbooks — researched and written by a coordinated team of 22 AI agents in more than 2 hours. [See how.](#how-these-handbooks-were-made)

## What Are Knowledge Work Plugins?

[Knowledge Work Plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) turn Claude into a specialist for your role. Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.ai) and compatible with Claude Code, each plugin bundles domain expertise, workflows, tool integrations, and slash commands for a specific business function — from marketing and sales to legal, finance, and data analysis.

The [official repository](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) provides the plugin source files: installation manifests, skill definitions, and connector configurations. These handbooks provide the **user manual** — what each plugin actually does, how to use every feature, and how to customize it for your industry and organization.

**The plugins are the engine. These handbooks are the driver's manual.**

## How These Handbooks Were Made

These handbooks were generated by a coordinated team of 22 AI agents — an orchestrator running Claude Opus 4.6 directing specialized sub-agents running Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5. The agents read every file in every plugin, cross-referenced architecture documentation, and wrote each handbook independently with full coverage of commands, skills, connectors, and customization options.

The full process completed in approximately 2 hours at an estimated API cost of ~$54.

For the complete breakdown — agent architecture, token usage, cost analysis, timing, and quality metrics — see the full [Execution Report](execution-report.md) ([PDF](execution-report.pdf)).
